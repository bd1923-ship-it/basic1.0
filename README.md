📌 Project Overview

This project implements a computer vision pipeline to classify handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset.
The workflow covers data → preprocessing → model → results, demonstrating how deep learning models can recognize digits from images.

📂 Dataset

Dataset Used: MNIST Dataset
Description: 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9).
Training set: 60,000 images
Test set: 10,000 images

Image Size: 28×28 pixels, grayscale.

🔄 Workflow
1. Data Collection
Loaded MNIST dataset using TensorFlow/Keras (tf.keras.datasets.mnist).
2. Preprocessing
Normalized pixel values from [0–255] to [0–1].
Reshaped images into 28x28x1 format for CNN input.
Applied one-hot encoding to labels (0–9).
3. Model
Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with:
Conv2D → MaxPooling → Dropout → Dense layers.
Optimizer: Adam
Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
Trained for 10 epochs with batch size 128.
4. Evaluation
Test Accuracy: ~99%
Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Sample Predictions.
📊 Key Results
The model achieved 99% accuracy on MNIST test data.
Example predictions:
Input Image	Predicted Digit
7	✅ 7
2	✅ 2
5	⚠️ misclassified as 3
